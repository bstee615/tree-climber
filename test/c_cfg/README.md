# C CFG Test Samples

This directory contains C source files for testing the CFG (Control Flow Graph) implementation. Each file has detailed documentation in its header comment.

## Files

- `basic_constructs.c` - Individual control flow constructs
- `nested_structures.c` - Complex nested combinations  
- `edge_cases.c` - Boundary conditions and edge cases
- `real_world_patterns.c` - Realistic programming patterns

## Usage

Used by the test suite in `src/tree_climber/cfg/test_c_cfg_comprehensive.py` to validate CFG generation.
