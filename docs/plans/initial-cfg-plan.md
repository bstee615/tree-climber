I'll create a framework for generating Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) from C code using py-tree-sitter with a visitor pattern and depth-first traversal.I've created a comprehensive CFG generation framework for C code using py-tree-sitter with a visitor pattern. Here are the key components:

## Core Classes:

1. **CFGNode**: Represents individual nodes in the CFG with type information, AST references, and successor/predecessor relationships.

2. **CFG**: The main graph structure that manages nodes and tracks entry/exit points.

3. **ControlFlowContext**: Maintains context during traversal, particularly for handling break/continue statements in loops.

## Visitor Pattern Implementation:

4. **CFGVisitor**: Base visitor class that implements the depth-first traversal pattern with a `visit()` method that dispatches to specific node handlers.

5. **CCFGVisitor**: C-specific implementation that handles:
   - Function definitions
   - Compound statements (blocks)
   - If statements with branching
   - While and for loops with proper back-edges
   - Break and continue statements
   - Return statements

## Key Features:

- **Depth-first traversal** with proper edge construction
- **Control flow context tracking** for nested loops
- **Multiple exit node handling** for complex control structures
- **Source text extraction** for node labeling
- **Visualization support** using Graphviz

## Usage Pattern:

1. Set up the tree-sitter parser for C
2. Parse source code into an AST
3. Use the visitor to walk the AST and build the CFG
4. Optionally visualize the result

The framework is extensible - you can add new node types and visitors for additional C constructs or other languages. The visitor pattern makes it easy to add new analysis passes over the same CFG structure.

To complete the setup, you'll need to install tree-sitter-c and configure the parser in the `setup_parser()` method with the actual language bindings.
