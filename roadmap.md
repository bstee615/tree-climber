# Goals

* [ ] Auto test with https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python and publish with https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish
* [ ] Stress tests
    * [ ] Parse Linux kernel.
    * [ ] Parse Big-Vul dataset https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_vulnerability_CSV_Dataset.
* [ ] Handle multiple files and functions correctly. Currently, we have only verified correct procedure when the program is a single function.
* [x] Rewrite for easier continued development
* [x] PDG (def-use graph)
